# 👋 Hello, I'm Sri Harshini!

I'm a passionate developer with experience in full-stack web development, machine learning, and automation. I love building smart applications that solve real-world problems — from pharmacy assistants powered by OCR to AI-driven supply chain tools and classroom behavior analysis platforms.

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **Pharmacist Assistant (Desktop App)**  
  A standalone software using Python and MySQL to extract medicines from handwritten prescriptions using Gemini OCR. Built with role-based dashboards (Admin, Pharmacist, Customer) and `.env` integration for credentials.

- **AI Supply Bot (Web App)**  
  A Django + React platform that fetches and indexes products using raw materials from e-commerce sites like Instacart. Integrates outreach tools like Apollo.io for connecting with manufacturers.

- **Classroom Behavior Analytics (Research Project)**  
  AI-powered analysis of student emotions, attention, and posture using datasets like FER2013, AffectNet, CMU Panoptic, and GazeCapture. Combines pretrained and custom-trained models for actionable classroom insights.
